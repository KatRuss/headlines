# Conventional Commits Git Template


A git repo template with a .githooks folder for regex validation of commit headers. This template uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

The file sits outside of the .git folder so it can be modified and shared with the rest of your team.

to activate the githook, just use the console command: 

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
